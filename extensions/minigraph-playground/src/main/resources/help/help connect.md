Connect two nodes together
--------------------------
1. Each connection is directional. Connect A to B is different from B to A.
2. A node must connect to one or more nodes. When a graph has orphan nodes, you cannot export the graph for deployment.

Syntax
------
```
connect {node-A} to {node-B} with {relation}
```
