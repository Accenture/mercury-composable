# CSV flow adapter configuration
#
# Each entry contains a map of staging, archive and flow ID
#
# When a new file is detected in the staging area, the corresponding
# flow with the given flow-ID will run.
#
# The first row of a CSV file contains the headers or "labels".
# Each subsequent row will trigger an event flow.
