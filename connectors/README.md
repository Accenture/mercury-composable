# Cloud connectors

The core modules include the foundation cloud connector and service monitor.

The "adapters" folder contains the specific implementation(s).

The cloud connectors and adapters are optional modules to build a minimalist service mesh.

## Cloud native skill requirements

Setting a service mesh requires cloud native and basic DevSecOps skills. Please contact your Accenture
representative if you need additional assistance.

## Event over HTTP

Sometimes, service mesh is not suitable. You may prefer the "Event over HTTP" method as an alternative to connect
application PODs.

Please review Chapter 7 in the "Developer guide" for details.
