# This CSV Flow Adapter demo does not have its own REST endpoint.
# The "/info" is a placeholder because REST automation needs
# at least one endpoint to start.

# The use of wildcard "*" should only be allowed for non-prod environments.

# For production, please add the "api.origin" key in the application.properties.
# In this example, the api.origin value will be used to override the value
# in "Access-Control-Allow-Origin".
