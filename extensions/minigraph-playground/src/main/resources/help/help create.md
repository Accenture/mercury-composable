Create a new node
-----------------
1. Root node must use the name 'root'
2. Skill is a property with the name 'skill'. A node has zero or one skill.
3. The 'create node' is a multi-line command
4. Properties are optional for a graph model. If present, they are used as default value.
5. For each property, you can use the "triple single quotes" to enter a multi-line value if needed.
6. Node name and type should use lower case characters and hyphen only
7. Type and key-values will be used and validated by the node's skill function if any
8. The key of a property can be a composable key using the dot-bracket format.
   The value may use Event Script's constant syntax.

Syntax

create node {name}

{key1}={value1}
