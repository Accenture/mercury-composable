#
# REST automation is the recommended way to create REST endpoints properly
# Note that URL comparison is case-insensitive but case sensitivity is preserved
# for the original URL and path parameters
#
# "event.api.service" accepts an external application making event call to a function in this app instance.
# It handles both RPC and drop-n-forget async requests
#
# Optionally, you can add "authentication" service to validate incoming request from the external application.
#
# You can merge this configuration file with your own rest.yaml if you want to turn on the "Event-over-HTTP"
# API endpoint. This can be done by adding this config file in the application.properties like this:
#
# yaml.rest.automation=classpath:/event-api.yaml, classpath:/rest.yaml
#
rest:
  - service: [ "event.api.service" ]
    methods: [ 'POST' ]
    url: "/api/event"
    timeout: 60s
    tracing: true
