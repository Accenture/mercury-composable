## Stack & Tools

> Canonical live home for the current stack — language version, dependencies, tool
> versions. `instructions.md` keeps only a high-level descriptor and points here.

- Language: Java 21 (virtual threads). (Kotlin appears only as an example module, not a framework language.)
  <!-- id: stack-language-java21 | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 2 | tier: core -->
- Build: Maven 3.9.7+ is the current build tool (multi-module reactor, `com.accenture.mercury:parent-mercury`).
  **Gradle support is planned to be added alongside it** (Eric, 2026-06-24 — see Open Thread `thread-add-gradle-build`).
  <!-- id: stack-build-maven | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 2 | tier: core -->
- Integration: Spring Boot (rest-spring-3 / -4 modules)
  <!-- id: stack-integration-spring | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 2 | tier: core -->
- Messaging: Kafka connectors; MsgPack wire serialization; customized Gson
  <!-- id: stack-messaging-kafka | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 2 | tier: core -->
- CI: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)
  <!-- id: stack-ci-gha | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 2 | tier: core -->
- Docs site: **Material for MkDocs** (switched from readthedocs 2026-07-20, mirroring the Rust
  port's mkdocs.yml). Mermaid renders natively via the `pymdownx.superfences` custom fence — all
  diagrams are mermaid blocks in the markdown (the scanned PNGs in `docs/guides/diagrams/` were
  removed). Reference pages (configuration, flow-schema, annotations, event-envelope) present
  keys/fields/methods as per-entry sections (heading + Type/Default mini-table + prose), not wide
  tables — same pattern as the Rust port, so the two sites stay structurally aligned. CI installs
  `mkdocs-material` in `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.

## Architectural Invariants

> Hard constraints that must never change. These never decay (`core`).

- Functions are fully decoupled — coupled only by route-name strings and
  `EventEnvelope`; orchestration lives in YAML event flows, not code. (ADR-0001)
  <!-- id: functions-decoupled-routes | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 11 | tier: core -->
- `TypedLambdaFunction` **key-by-key data mapping** (Event Script Layer 2, Knowledge Graph Layer 3)
  requires Map or PoJo — a List cannot be mapped field-by-field. The **`*` whole-body passthrough**
  (`model.list -> *`) bypasses key-by-key mapping and, with `@PreLoad(inputPojoClass=…)`, enables
  `List<PoJo>` at the function boundary in an Event Script flow. Layer 1 (Platform Core) uses the
  same `inputPojoClass` for external JSON-list ingestion. (ADR-0003)
  <!-- id: typed-io-map-or-pojo | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 8 | tier: core -->
- Functions execute on **Java 21 virtual threads** over the Vert.x in-memory event bus; a synchronous
  PostOffice RPC (`po.request`) suspends the virtual thread and releases its carrier, so sequential
  blocking-style code performs on par with reactive — and a function may still return `Mono`/`Flux`.
  This is why e.g. 250 instances of a blocking `sync.await` are cheap. (ADR-0002)

## Key Decisions

- **Release 4.8.3 — SHIPPED 2026-07-13 (tag `v4.8.3` on merge commit `6696a76f`; PRs #168-#175).**
  Security patch + hardening release, validated by the field pipeline (Snyk + Sonar PASSED) BEFORE
  tagging — the deliberate deferred-tag flow worked as designed. Contents: (1) **Snyk remediation**
  (#168 — httpcore5 5.4.3 via SB property override, log4j-api 2.26.1, reactor-netty 1.3.6);
  (2) **trace-continuity regression guards** (#169 HTTP app-to-app, #175 declarative flow task incl.
  the sink-after-response shape — BOTH verified passing on v4.7.1 too, so the field's declarative
  report was environmental, not a framework defect); (3) **observability + REST per-entry header docs**
  (#169/#172); (4) **ScheduleAdminTest + SonarQube touch-up** (#170/#173 — file-existence ≠ readiness;
  HelloException → HelloExceptionHandler; S5443 suppressions per ProfileStore precedent);
  (5) **kafka.health** (#174 — `KafkaConsumer.listTopics` Metadata probe needs NO ACL: brokers filter
  by Topic Describe rather than reject, so it degrades to an empty-but-successful response under
  locked-down principals; startup grace returns placeholder-healthy while the client warms up on a
  background virtual thread; `kafka.health.timeout` 5s / `kafka.health.startup.grace` 30s).
  **Durable lessons:** field screenshots' naming conventions are client-identifiable — paraphrase
  generically in fixtures/commits/PRs; a flow needs ≥1 `end` task (a `sink` only terminates a side
  branch). See [[release-4-8-2-shipped]] for the prior cycle.

- **Field trace-propagation report on 4.6.3 diagnosed (2026-07-13): not a framework bug.** A field team
  saw the traceId stop propagating between application endpoints after upgrading 4.4.11 → 4.6.3. Root
  cause: **v4.5.0's documented breaking tracing cleanup** — `trace.http.header` /
  `trace.http.legacy.header.enabled` removed, so `X-Correlation-Id` no longer doubles as the trace id
  (the pre-4.5.0 conflation is what made 4.4.x setups appear to propagate); the trace id now travels
  only as `X-Trace-Id` / W3C `traceparent`, never echoed back. **Support checklist for this symptom:**
  (1) `tracing: true` on every rest.yaml entry involved (per-endpoint, default FALSE — without it the
  endpoint ignores inbound trace headers); (2) app-to-app calls must go through `async.http.request`
  (only the framework HTTP client auto-stamps X-Trace-Id + traceparent; custom/Spring clients must
  forward `traceparent` manually); (3) trace context is thread-bound (Mono path fixed in 4.6.x —
  [[trace-thread-keyed-mono-gotcha]]). **Validated**: live sync-over-async-demo (2 JVMs, curl with a
  caller traceparent → one continuous trace, spans chained onto the caller's span across both Kafka
  hops) + new regression test `traceContinuesAcrossApplicationToApplicationHttpCall`
  (branch `test/trace-continuity-http-hop`, `DownstreamCaller` fixture + `/api/chain/probe`) proving
  traced app-to-app HTTP continuity over the real HTTP stack — a previously untested contract.

- **Snyk gate rejected v4.8.2 in the field (2026-07-13) — remediated and MERGED (PR #168, merge
  commit `e21be449`, 30 poms; ships in v4.8.3; the team trials v4.7.1 for the trace fix meanwhile —
  4.7.1 carries the same three vulnerable transitives, so it is trial-only, not deployable).** Three transitive findings, all
  reported through org.platformlambda artifacts: httpcore5/-h2 5.4.2→5.4.3 (HIGH CWE-770), log4j-api
  2.25.4→2.26.1 (MEDIUM CWE-116), reactor-netty-http 1.3.5→1.3.6 via reactor-bom 2025.0.5→2025.0.6
  (MEDIUM CWE-319). **Durable lessons:** (1) **Spring Boot's `dependencyManagement` beats
  nearest-wins** — a direct dependency pin does NOT propagate to consumers when SB's parent manages
  the artifact (why Snyk said "no supported fix"); the correct idiom is overriding the SB *property*
  (`httpcore5.version`, like `log4j2.version`/`tomcat.version`/`netty.version`) in **every** module
  that resolves the chain (here: the six Confluent-chain modules). The scram-client direct-pin
  precedent only worked because no management was in play. (2) **A dependency-version sweep must also
  find poms *missing* the property** — the 4.8.1 log4j sweep updated only poms that already had
  `log4j2.version`, leaving four on SB's vulnerable default. (3) Reactor-wide verification =
  `mvn dependency:tree` grep for the vulnerable versions across all modules **plus** the non-reactor
  subprojects (api-playground, pg-example, benchmark-reporter — field scans cover them too).

- **Release 4.8.2 — SHIPPED 2026-07-12 (tag `v4.8.2` on merge commit `6c024311`; PRs #164-#166).**
  Patch release: twin-kafka-demo correlation-id impedance matching + opt-in template
  externalization. Cross-vendor loop precedent: GitHub Copilot authored the patch (its session log
  2026-07-13-001009), crashed mid-task; Claude Code reviewed all edits, completed the crash gap
  (twin-kafka.md table, configuration-reference rows, sync-over-async properties) and committed with
  dual attribution (one Co-Authored-By per collaborator per AGENTS.md). **Durable facts:**
  (1) **Impedance matching is the demo pattern:** each cluster keeps its own business
  correlation-id header (on-prem X-Correlation-Id, cloud X-Cloud-Correlation-Id); adapters read the
  cluster header into model.cid, flows map model.cid back out under the NEXT cluster's name — never
  leak a cluster's header name across the bridge (twin-kafka tests assert this at the wire level).
  (2) **Template externalization is OPT-IN** (scope: minimalist-kafka/twin-kafka family only):
  KafkaClientConfig + SecondaryKafkaAutoStart location defaults are classpath-only; devops
  pipelines set the location key to a rendered file, optionally with a classpath fallback chain —
  field migration note in the 4.8.2 CHANGELOG (deployments relying on the implicit /tmp/config
  fallback must set keys explicitly). Legacy connector stack + mini-scheduler keep their own
  file-first conventions. (3) **SOR response leg publishes via secondary.kafka.notification** —
  the demo response stays on the cloud cluster until the bridge consumes it; Spring profiles are
  logical personalities, not security boundaries (README documents that real isolation needs
  separate deployment/credentials/network policy). (4) **Release-sweep gotcha:** when the outgoing
  version is a substring of a dependency version (classgraph 4.8.184 contains "4.8.1"), the perl
  sweep needs a digit lookahead `(?!\d)` — not every bump is naturally safe.
  See [[release-4-8-1-shipped]] for the prior cycle's facts.

- **Release 4.8.1 — SHIPPED 2026-07-11 (tag `v4.8.1` on merge commit `3d226c5b`; PRs #159-#161).**
  Maintenance release: dependency security updates (Jackson 2.22.1 closed dependabot/28; log4j2/
  netty/tomcat/gson/vertx refreshed), twin-kafka-demo, SimpleRandomPartitioner, DSA retirement and
  the repo-wide coverage program. **Durable facts:** (1) **SimpleRandomPartitioner is
  minimalist-kafka's producer DEFAULT** (`putIfAbsent` in KafkaClientConfig — a template's own
  `partitioner.class` wins; explicit `partition` header bypasses partitioners; keyed records keep
  murmur2; SecureRandom shared instance — ThreadLocal avoided per repo convention). Kafka's sticky
  default starves multi-instance consumer groups at low volume — proven in the demo (all-on-one
  partition before, spread after). (2) **CryptoApi DSA methods REMOVED** (4.8.1) — the SHA256withDSA
  field-Sonar hotspot is resolved at the source; no UI disposition needed. (3) **Ten example modules
  build+test inside the reactor** (pg-example standalone: embedded-postgres binary download;
  benchmark-reporter off) — release-bump sweep is now 32 poms; CI runs ~918 tests. (4) **Coverage
  aggregate 85.8% line / 80.0% Sonar-combined** — zero margin: field Sonar config should exclude
  `benchmark/**` (938 untested lines), and pg-example's coverage needs its own `mvn test` in the
  pipeline. kafka-connector's remaining gap (topic substitution + boot branches) needs a second
  test-app config — not reachable in one JVM. (5) **Flow-authoring conventions** (learned via
  twin-kafka-demo, examples/twin-kafka-demo): the engine does NOT auto-convert a Map into a
  byte[]-typed function — use `f:binary(model.x) -> *` (the `:binary` colon shorthand is
  DEPRECATED); set `text(application/json) -> output.header.content-type` on flow HTTP responses
  (platform-core otherwise content-negotiates from the request's accept header). (6) **No version
  strings in pom comments** — the release sweep mangled a historical "retired 4.8.0" note; history
  belongs in the CHANGELOG. See [[release-4-8-0-shipped]] for the twin-kafka architecture facts.

- **Release 4.8.0 — SHIPPED 2026-07-10 (tag `v4.8.0` on merge commit `5d9fda45`; PRs #153-#157).**
  Feature release: **twin-kafka** (dual Kafka cluster bridging), configurable trace-id headers with
  per-entry overrides, and the hardened model.cid path. **Durable architecture facts:**
  (1) **twin-kafka is a separate `system/` module depending on minimalist-kafka** — dual-cluster is a
  special case; single-cluster apps must never carry its weight. Naming: module twin-kafka, artifacts
  `secondary.*` (plain English; "gemini" rejected — GEMINI.md/Google clash). A bridge is flow YAML:
  consume via one adapter, publish via the other cluster's notification function; trace + model.cid
  continuous across both hops. (2) **Reuse seams in minimalist-kafka** (behavior-preserving):
  KafkaClientConfig location-key overloads; SimpleKafkaNotification protected accessors (publisher/
  codec/header names/registryUrlKey); SchemaCodec.fromConfig(config, url, keyPrefix) deriving keys,
  serde prefix, template location AND ManagedCache names from the prefix — **distinct caches per
  registry are a correctness requirement** (Confluent global schema ids are per-registry; bridging
  framed payloads = decode-and-re-encode via schema.enabled + subject, NEVER relay raw framed bytes).
  (3) Registry is optional PER CLUSTER (real-world: on-prem Apache + cloud Confluent); Azure Event
  Hubs works via the Kafka endpoint (no Confluent registry, pre-provisioned topics). (4) DLQ
  correctness: RetryPolicy carries the publisher → secondary dead letters land on the secondary
  cluster. (5) kafka-standalone `dual.servers=true` = broker 9092 + broker 8092; twin templates
  default to 8092. (6) **Header-name precedence** (both surfaces): per-entry (rest.yaml /
  kafka-flow-adapter.yaml `trace.id.header`/`correlation.id.header`) > application.properties global
  (`http/kafka.trace.id.header`, `http/kafka.correlation.id.header`) > built-in default; W3C
  traceparent always wins for the trace-id. (7) **Flow convention:** map the business correlation-id
  from `model.cid` (engine-seeded), never from the raw record header; CompileFlows rejects data
  mappings that overwrite reserved model keys (cid/instance/flow/ttl). See [[release-4-7-0-shipped]]
  for the release-bump surface and prior caveats.

- **Release 4.7.0 — SHIPPED 2026-07-08 (tag `v4.7.0` on merge commit `e41a20b7`; PRs #146 feature +
  #147 bump).** Feature release: **MiniGraph `graph.task` skill** — a Task node invokes any composable
  function (`@PreLoad` route) with Event Script style `input[]`/`output[]` mapping (`*` whole-body
  sequential merge, `header.{name}`, PoJo auto-conversion, `for_each[]`+`concurrency` fork-join,
  `exception=` routing); plus tutorial-13 (deployed graph + help topics) and playground UI bundle
  refresh. **STRATEGIC (Eric): graph.task is intended to be the LAST built-in skill** — custom logic
  now enters a graph as a composable function; flows/subgraphs (graph.extension) remain for
  orchestration. **Durable caveats:** (1) **new-skill/tutorial checklist** — a shipped `help graph-*.md`
  page MUST have a matching entry in `docs/guides/knowledge-graph/minigraph-commands.json` and the docs
  mirror (skills-reference, command-reference matrix, index tables — "eight skills" counts); CI's
  `scripts/check-minigraph-grammar.py` anti-drift gate fails the PR otherwise (caught live on PR #146);
  (2) `help.md` topic index is hand-maintained — new skills/tutorials must be added there too;
  (3) test-only tutorial graphs are numbered 1xx (tutorial-113/114) so deployed tutorials own the
  canonical names. Release-bump surface and prior caveats unchanged — see [[release-4-6-2-shipped]].
  **UPDATE 2026-07-09: v4.7.1 shipped the next day** (tag on merge commit `60716bf9`; PRs #150 feature +
  #151 bump) — **minimalist-kafka Schema Registry OAuth 2.0**, closing the 4.6.3 field loose ends.
  Durable facts: (1) **`schema-registry.properties` is the third client template** (verbatim pass-through
  to the Confluent SR client; `schema.registry.url` stays in application.properties as the feature
  switch — Eric: "layered approach that is a best practice"); (2) **OAuthUrlAllowList auto-registers
  token endpoint URLs** on the JVM system property `org.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls`
  at template-load time (merge/dedupe, never clobber) — BOTH the Kafka transport and the Confluent SR
  OAuth provider validate against it (Confluent reuses Kafka's ConfigurationUtils.validateUrl);
  (3) **CODE CONVENTION: prefer `ReentrantLock` over `synchronized`** in framework code
  (virtual-thread friendly — Eric's review feedback); (4) EmbeddedSchemaRegistry has an opt-in OAuth
  mode (HS256 token endpoint + Bearer enforcement) for authenticated registry tests.

- **Release 4.6.1 — security + maintenance patch on top of 4.6.0 (2026-07-06, branch `chore/release-4.6.1`,
  Claude Code).** 4.6.0 was already GitHub-released (tag `v4.6.0`, immutable); rather than recall/re-tag it,
  Eric chose to supersede with a clean 4.6.1 (treat a published release as immutable). **Scope:** (1) **Snyk
  OSS fixes** — `org.postgresql:r2dbc-postgresql` 1.1.1→1.1.2 in `examples/pg-example` +
  `extensions/reactive-postgres`, plus direct `com.ongres.scram:scram-client`/`scram-common` `3.3` deps that
  override the transitive **vulnerable 3.2** r2dbc-postgresql 1.1.2 pulls in (same coords + major → nearest-wins,
  no leftover 3.2; Eric confirmed Snyk wants 3.3); (2) **`opentelemetry-forwarder` — protobuf runtime removed
  from the module entirely** — OTel BOM 1.45.0→1.63.0 and dropped the test-scoped
  `io.opentelemetry.proto:opentelemetry-proto` (the only thing pulling in `com.google.protobuf`, retired for a
  no-fix CVE). Verified `com.google.protobuf` resolves on **no scope**. Production export path was already
  protobuf-java-free (OTLP/HTTP exporter uses OTel's internal marshaler in `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-common`,
  not protobuf-java). **`MockOtlpCollector` (test) rewritten** to decode OTLP protobuf with a small hand-rolled
  wire-format `ProtoReader` (no generated classes); full round-trip coverage retained (22 tests green). Key bug
  found+fixed during the rewrite: a `pos += (int) readVarint()` compound-assignment discarded the read-advance
  (Java captures the LHS before the RHS mutates `pos`). (3) **Added two OTLP exporter tunables** —
  `otel.exporter.otlp.compression` (`gzip`/`none`, default `none`) + `otel.exporter.otlp.connect.timeout`
  (ms, default 10000), wired via a new 5-arg `OtelForwarderContext.buildExporter` (old 3-arg kept, defaults
  unchanged). Harness limitation noted: Mercury REST automation delivers a `null` body for a gzip-encoded
  request, so the gzip test asserts `Content-Encoding: gzip` on the wire rather than an inflate-decode round-trip.
  **Version bump 4.6.0→4.6.1:** 31 module poms + CHANGELOG (Security/Added/Changed) + docs/guides + example/helper
  READMEs + CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md + memory current-version refs. **Pre-existing, left as-is:** `OtelForwarderContext.VERSION`
  instrumentation-scope constant still reads `4.5.0` (was not bumped for 4.6.0 either — out of release scope; flagged).

- **platform-core gotcha: the per-function trace context is thread-id-keyed and torn down when the worker
  returns.** `EventEmitter.traces` is keyed by `Thread.currentThread().threadId()+instance+route`, and
  `WorkerHandler` calls `stopTracing` (removing it) as soon as `processEvent` returns. So any work that
  finishes on a **different thread or after the worker returns** (notably a `Mono`/`Flux` completion on the
  reactor executor) **cannot** call `getTrace(...)` to read its own span/annotations — it must **capture the
  `TraceInfo` on the worker thread first**. This caused Mono-returning flow tasks to drop their `span_id`
  from the response, orphaning the next task's `parent_span_id` (fixed 2026-06-28 in
  `WorkerHandler.handleMonoResponse` via `applyTraceContext`; see `WorkerHandlerTest.monoResponseForwardsSpanId`).
  Watch for this in any future async/reactive code that needs trace context. The **Flux** path was checked
  and is **safe** — it returns its response (the `x-stream-id` handle) synchronously on the worker thread, and
  `FluxPublisher` streaming never reads the trace (guarded by `WorkerHandlerTest.fluxResponseForwardsSpanId`).

- **platform-core serializes `java.time.Instant` as first-class (2026-06-27).** Instant had no adapter and
  round-tripped wrongly (Gson reflected it to `{seconds,nanos}`; MsgPack fell through to String/PoJo).
  Fixed at the root in all three serialization paths — `SimpleMapper` (Gson adapter), `MsgPack` (nested
  `case Instant`), `PayloadMapper` (top-level encode) — each mirroring `Date` via
  `date2str(Date.from(instant))` → UTC, **millisecond-precision** ISO-8601/RFC-3339 string (same wire format
  as Date; sub-ms precision is intentionally dropped for consistency). Prefer `Instant` over `java.util.Date`
  in new code (also clears SonarQube `java:S2143`). Relates to `typed-io-map-or-pojo` (ADR-0003).

- **Service mesh is opt-in, not the default.** `cloud.connector=none` is the framework default. The Kafka
  service mesh (`cloud.connector=kafka` + presence-monitor) solves exactly two problems: (1) synchronous
  request-response across application instances over Kafka (sync over async), and (2) service discovery
  between pods. Applications that do not need either must be designed cloud-native (self-contained,
  horizontally scaled, no cross-instance coupling). Superimposing sync over async is a recipe for a
  "distributed monolith" — full operational cost of distribution with monolith-level coupling. The mesh is an
  advanced opt-in for specific use cases (cross-application RPC, leader selection, pod-aware broadcast).
  This preference must be front-and-center in documentation and AI guides. (ADR-0006)

- **Event Script config is preferred over code for orchestration.** When a step is orchestration —
  sequencing functions, branching, failure handling, moving data — express it as Event Script YAML
  (tasks, `execution` types, I/O data mapping, exception handler), not imperative code; code is reserved
  for the unit of work (the function body). Two reasons: it **communicates intent** (the flow file is a
  legible statement of the event flow — sequence, topics, fail-fast path, branches — without reading
  Java) and it **manages dependencies** (the engine enforces control- and data-flow wiring, functions
  stay decoupled per `functions-decoupled-routes`, reusable blocks like `simple.kafka.notification` are
  composed by reference not duplicated). Bounded by `one-atom-four-roles`: not all code becomes YAML — an
  intrinsically in-function concern (e.g. a blocking rendezvous that must wrap a publish) stays in code.
  Routing vocabulary to learn: `decision` selects a `next` entry by value (`true`=`1`=first, `false`=`2`=
  second; integer is 1-based → multi-way switch — engine `TaskExecutor.handleDecisionTask`, intentional;
  several *derived* docs had it inverted and were corrected 2026-06-27), and `byte[]` rides through
  `model` via the `*` passthrough. Distilled from the sync-over-async composable refactoring (2026-06-27,
  Claude Code). (ADR-0007)

## Conventions

- Add capability: function (`@PreLoad` + `TypedLambdaFunction`) → flow YAML →
  register in `flows.yaml` → `rest.yaml` mapping if HTTP-facing.
  <!-- id: conv-add-capability | created: 2026-06-20 | last_used: 2026-06-24 | uses: 2 | tier: core -->
- Watch serialization gotchas (Long↔Integer downcast; use `util.str2int/str2long`).

- **Worker-instance count encodes the concurrency pattern** (Eric, 2026-07-13): `instances=1` is the
  deliberate "singleton" for ASYNCHRONOUS functions — it serializes processing to guarantee message
  sequencing and lets the event system's back-pressure/overflow buffering absorb bursts. For
  RPC-style (request-response) functions, seldom use a singleton: a blocked single worker can
  DEADLOCK (callers await a reply while the only worker itself waits on something that needs another
  invocation). Shared non-thread-safe resources inside a multi-worker function are guarded by a
  `ReentrantLock`, not by dropping to one worker (kafka.health precedent: 5 workers, lock-confined
  KafkaConsumer).

- **Test config injection: use the EXACT config key as a System property, never a `${VAR}` reference
  set in `@BeforeAll`** (2026-07-14, from the second field Jenkins twin-kafka failure). Three facts
  interact: (1) `AppConfigReader` resolves `${VAR}` references ONCE when the singleton first loads;
  (2) surefire runs a module's test classes in ONE JVM and its default run order is
  filesystem-dependent (differs per CI environment — GitHub passed, field Jenkins failed);
  (3) any test class whose constructor chain touches `AppConfigReader.getInstance()` (e.g. a health
  check's `resolveDurationMs`) freezes every unresolved reference for the whole JVM.
  `ConfigReader.get()` checks `System.getProperty(<exact key>)` live on EVERY read, so exact-key
  injection is immune to class order (`KafkaFlowAdapterTest` pattern; `TwinKafkaBridgeTest` fixed to
  match, + surefire `runOrder=alphabetical` pinned in twin-kafka so all environments run the same
  adversarial order). Env-style `${VAR}` injection stays safe ONLY for configs loaded fresh after
  the test sets them (e.g. Kafka client templates). Corollary: a boot-poll deadline expiring usually
  means a `@MainApplication` CRASHED (check AppStarter "Unable to start" ERROR), not a slow executor
  — PR #178's deadline extension treated a symptom of this very bug. Relates
  [[conv-instance-count-pattern]] (the health-check tests that shifted the class order arrived with
  kafka.health/secondary.kafka.health).

- [ ] (field support — 2026-07-13; ROOT CAUSE FOUND via Eric's devops screen share) **Trace-propagation
  report: the internal API gateway strips `traceparent` AND `X-Trace-Id` (neither on its allow-list);
  only `X-Correlation-Id` passes.** 4.4.11 "worked" because `trace.http.header=X-Correlation-Id, X-Trace-Id`
  made the trace ride the allow-listed first entry. Correction to the field's initial write-up: 4.6.3+
  DOES emit X-Trace-Id alongside traceparent on every traced outbound call (verified in code + wire-level
  tests on v4.7.1) — the gateway eats both. Fix options: (a) config-only on 4.8.3:
  `http.trace.id.header=X-Correlation-Id` both apps (caveat: cid wins the shared slot when ids diverge);
  (b) a proposed `legacy.trace.id` flag — **REJECTED by Eric (2026-07-13): no code change; re-mixing the
  business correlation-id with the trace id makes things worse — the goal is proper traceId/spanId/
  parentSpanId propagation**; (c) gateway allow-list change (add `traceparent` + `X-Trace-Id`
  pass-through) = **THE fix — Eric is taking it to the infra team**.**Original checklist below retained.**
  Trace-propagation report on 4.6.3: confirm the field config fix. Diagnosis + support checklist in
  [[field-trace-propagation-4-6-3-diagnosis]]; the two questions back to the team: is `tracing: true` set
  on every rest.yaml endpoint involved, and is the app-to-app call made through `async.http.request` (vs
  a custom/Spring HTTP client that must forward `traceparent` itself)? Regression test + observability
  impedance-matching docs MERGED (PR #169); ScheduleAdminTest race fix MERGED (PR #170 — file existence
  ≠ readiness when writes are truncate-then-write; poll the consuming API for settled state). The team
  trials v4.7.1 for the trace behavior while v4.8.3 is prepared. Also answered (2026-07-13): setting
  `http.trace.id.header` = `http.correlation.id.header` = `X-Correlation-Id` (legacy conflation) is safe
  when the edge always supplies the header — one value feeds both ids end-to-end. **UPDATE 2026-07-14:
  the absent-header divergence was FIXED** (`fix/conflated-header-id-unification`) — when the resolved
  trace/cid header names collide and the shared header is absent, both ingress paths (HTTP + Kafka
  adapter) now yield ONE id (trace authoritative, honors traceparent; cid adopts it). Divergence remains
  by design only for DISTINCT names. **VALIDATED by Eric 2026-07-14 (merged as PR #179, in the post-#181
  main)**: complete local build + live two-app hop with no header supplied → downstream saw traceparent
  trace-id == x-correlation-id (one generated id). Supplied-header case also validated (abc123 fed both
  ids across the hop). Demo pair for reproducing: composable-example (8100) -> lambda-example (8085)
  via /api/cross/app/tracing; traceId confirmed in BOTH apps' trace logs for both cases. Support nuance: with conflation, the outbound trace id rides the CONFIGURED header
  name (X-Correlation-Id), and traceparent is stamped only when the id is W3C-shaped (32-hex) — a short
  business id travels on the shared header alone, which is exactly why this works behind the
  traceparent-stripping gateway. Telemetry confirmed spanId/parentSpanId chain correctly within each
  app under the shared trace id; CROSS-app span parenting still needs traceparent (it carries the
  caller's span id), so tooling stitches by trace id until the gateway passes traceparent — positive
  case VERIFIED live too: with traceparent on the wire (generated 32-hex id), lambda-example's
  hello.world span parented directly onto the traceparent's span id across the HTTP hop. Field runs this conflation short-term; gateway team has been ASKED (2026-07-14) to
  allow-list traceparent + X-Trace-Id at the gateway/Istio — Eric updates after the devops team
  tests in the cloud dev environment.

- [ ] (P0–P5 code-complete — Claude Code, 2026-07-05, branch `feature/elastic-queue-file-fifo`; remaining = field canary → P4 retire-BDB) **Replace
  ElasticQueue's Berkeley DB spill tier with a portable file-backed segmented FIFO.** Full detail + rationale
  (perf/complexity/Rust portability) in the Key Decision [[elastic-queue-file-fifo-plan]] and the design spec
  `draft-design-specs/elastic_queue_file_fifo_design.md` (gitignored). **P0 (`fc225d34`):** quantified the BDB
  event-loop tail. **P1 (`07221351`):** `ElasticQueue` → facade over an `ElasticStore` strategy
  (`elastic.queue.store = bdb | file`, default `bdb`); `BdbElasticStore` = old logic verbatim, `FileElasticStore`
  = new per-route segmented append FIFO; parity test passes both. Worse-case file vs bdb: write p99.9
  1.63ms→0.035ms (~46×), read max 98ms→3.9ms (~25×), stalls>20ms 53→2 — **tail flattened.** **P2 (`2885d9e3`):**
  hardening tests (multi-segment FIFO, bounded-disk reclamation, no-leak across 50 reuse cycles, clean reuse,
  degenerate inputs); `segmentBytes` → per-instance config. **Root-caused the 582ms `file` outlier: NOT GC**
  (max GC pause 2.0ms) → OS dirty-page-flush throttle. Decided (Eric): no in-store flusher; **P5 elevated to
  RECOMMENDED** (per-route VT off-loading makes on-loop spill stalls harmless) + **document tmpfs**. Full
  platform-core 381 green. Remaining P2: external-IO fault injection (needs a mockable seam; deferred).
  **P3 A/B (`73d1959a`, reports saved via `-Dbench.report`):** file vs bdb — throughput +56%, write p99.9
  1.66ms→0.035ms (~47×), read max 54ms→3.5ms (~15×), stalls>20ms 90→3; file's only blemish a single 552ms
  OS-flush outlier (bdb's badness is pervasive: 90 stalls). **`file` decisively flattens the tail — goal met.**
  **P5 (`e8e5cdee`):** off-loop dispatch — `elastic.queue.dispatch = loop | vthread` (default `loop`); in
  `vthread` a per-route virtual thread runs the `ServiceQueue` state machine + blocking spill I/O, so the
  552ms OS-flush stall parks the VT carrier, not the shared loop. Full platform-core 381 green in BOTH modes;
  `DispatchBenchmark` loop 83k vs vthread 98k events/s (+18% under load, no hot-path regression); measured
  mailbox fast-path overhead ~5–9µs/dispatch. **Reactor validation (`dd77f067`) found BDB pins VT carriers**
  (vthread+bdb starved minigraph; vthread+file green everywhere) → **simplified to ONE switch:**
  `elastic.queue.store` alone (`bdb`⇒loop, `file`⇒vthread, derived from `supportsVirtualThreadDispatch()`);
  removed the standalone `elastic.queue.dispatch` config so vthread+bdb is unreachable. Verified: platform-core
  381 green both modes, minigraph 55 green with file.
  **Cleanup isolation (`70c9feff`):** annotated the `elastic.queue.cleanup` `Cleanup` class `@KernelThreadRunner`
  so its heavy BDB `cleanLog()`/cursor work runs on a kernel thread — closes a live in-field VT-pinning vector
  (independent of dispatch mode). **Canary field notes** drafted at
  `draft-design-specs/elastic-queue-file-mode-field-notes.md` (gitignored; graduate into the PR/runbook at merge).
  **All phases P0–P5 + the mode simplification + cleanup isolation implemented + tested; submitted as
  PR [#137](https://github.com/Accenture/mercury-composable/pull/137)** (`feature/elastic-queue-file-fifo` →
  `main`; opt-in, BDB stays default). **Field-test prep (2026-07-05, on the same branch, NOT pushed yet):**
  (1) flipped the default to `file` (`6e21fcd1`; bdb = explicit fallback; platform-core 381 green on the new
  default); (2) added the `benchmark/benchmark-reporter` module (`e4c39aee`) — self-contained single-JVM
  callback+RPC end-to-end harness → self-contained HTML report (inline SVG histogram + percentile plot),
  runnable in the field/pipeline, records store+dispatch for file-vs-bdb A/B. **Open decision for Eric:** the
  flip inverts PR #137's "default unchanged" premise — fold into #137 (re-frame) or split into a follow-up PR;
  **Eric chose (2026-07-05): fold into PR #137 + re-frame** (file = default + benchmark tooling); pushed
  `44202a57`, so #137 is now the whole field-test-ready change (re-framed title/description handed to Eric).
  **Review hardening (GitHub Copilot, 2026-07-05):** bounded the off-loop dispatch mailbox
  (`elastic.queue.dispatch.mailbox.size`, default 1024, clamped ≥ memory buffer) with no-drop back-pressure;
  changed `FileElasticStore` to keep only O(1) segment channels open, add RUNNING/keepalive stale-dir cleanup,
  purge current leftovers at startup, and clear `peeked` on reset for both stores; added regressions + small
  benchmark-reporter smoke. **Next = field steps: run benchmark-reporter on real envs, then P4 retire BDB.** Docs/ADR sync tracked

- [ ] (docs backlog — Eric, 2026-06-24) **Documentation improvement — serve both audiences, every sprint.**
  The standing purpose of the documentation sprints (sharpens the dual-design principle in
  `docs-rewrite-architecture` / `docs-content-canon`; extends `bp-docs-ai-human-rewrite`,
  `thread-next-ai-context`): **for humans — storytelling: engaging, why-before-how, a narrative arc;**
  **for AI agents — token-efficient: the shortest path to the point, machine-greppable, "generate from
  this page alone."** These are the acceptance criteria for every doc change. Backlog of concrete items
  (grows as findings surface; first batch from a fresh-agent discovery pass on 2026-06-24 — building the
  OTel forwarder via `llms.txt` → REST-automation guide):
  - **Biggest gap: an AI-agent "boot & test an app" recipe.** Authoring a `rest.yaml` was well-documented;
    *standing up and testing* an app was not — had to read platform-core source + test fixtures for
    `AutoStart.main`, the minimal `application.properties` (`rest.automation`/`web.component.scan`/`server.port`),
    `@PreLoad` base-package auto-scan, and the `AsyncHttpRequest` service contract (incl. returning an empty 200).
  - **Surface the working test-fixture pattern** (`TestBase` + a service function + test `rest.yaml`) as a
    documented example — it was the single highest-signal context, yet lives only in `src/test`.
  - **Machine-readable runtime-API signatures** — like the DSL `*.json` catalogs (`docs-dsl-spec`) but for
    `AsyncHttpRequest`/`AutoStart`/`AppConfigReader`; agents grep source for exact signatures today.
  - **Repo-relative links in `llms.txt`** (alongside the published URLs) so an in-repo agent maps map→file in one hop.
  - Re-validate each pass with the **fresh-agent test** (`docs-dsl-spec` methodology): can a clean agent build
    *and test* from the docs alone?
  Second batch — from building the **whole** OpenTelemetry forwarder feature end-to-end (2026-06-24), where the
  recurring friction was *grepping platform-core source* for things prose didn't cover (AI-context-discovery focus):
  - **Reserved-route extension contract + a machine-readable dataset schema.** Writing a `distributed.trace.forwarder`
    meant reverse-engineering the trace-metrics map shape (`id`/`span_id`/`parent_span_id`/`service`/`path`/`from`/
    `origin`/`start`/`exec_time`/`round_trip`/`success`/`status`/`exception` + `annotations`) from `Telemetry`/
    `WorkerHandler`. Document the reserved routes (`distributed.trace.forwarder`, `transaction.journal.recorder`) with
    a JSON dataset schema like the DSL `*.json` catalogs. *(The new Observability guide now documents the dataset in
    prose — the goal is the machine-readable schema.)*
  - **"Author a reusable extension" recipe + the auto-registration fact.** The cornerstone — `@PreLoad` classes under
    the base packages (`org.platformlambda.*`/`com.accenture.*`) are *always* scanned, so dropping the jar on the
    classpath auto-registers the route — lives only in `SimpleClassScanner` source.
  - **Document `${ENV_VAR:default}` config substitution** (`AppConfigReader`), incl. an unset `${VAR}` with no default
    resolving to null — central to production config + keeping secrets out of files; learned from Eric, not the docs.
  - **Test server-readiness via the `async.http.response` provider** (`Platform.waitForProvider`), not `Thread.sleep`
    — the signal the HTTP server registers after `listen()`; found in `AppStarter` source. Folds into the boot-&-test recipe.
  - **Drive an Event Script flow programmatically** (`FlowExecutor.request(originator, traceId, tracePath, flowId,
    dataset, cid, timeout)`) and document the synthetic `task.executor` flow-summary span — needed for testing flows.
  - **Surface the machine-readable catalogs in `llms.txt`** (the DSL `*.json` files) as first-class entries, and add
    "build & test an app" + "author an extension" entries so an agent doesn't discover them only by reading prose.

- [ ] (next iteration — Eric, 2026-06-24; **design + implement**) **Cross-pod request-response via Redis
  Pub/Sub RPC + Kafka.** A distributed sync-over-async pattern (an advanced opt-in use case, cf.
  `kafka-mesh-opt-in`): `REST sync request-response → Composable service (POD-1) → Redis Pub/Sub RPC + Kafka
  **outbound** topic; Kafka **inbound** topic (response) → Composable service (POD-2) → Redis`. A
  **correlation-id** is the return-path reference so Redis routes the response back to POD-1. Build:
  (1) a composable function interfacing **Redis** + Kafka send/receive topics; (2) a **minimalist Kafka flow
  adapter (inbound)**; (3) a **Kafka notification function (outbound)**. Items (2)+(3) are the scope of
  `thread-minimalist-kafka-adapter` — now folded into this larger concept. → serves `vision-mercury-composable`.
  **Prototyping started 2026-06-25 on branch `feature/sync-over-async`** (design reviewed from Eric's spec).
  **Locked decisions:** return path = **Redis** (cloud-native REST facade for UI apps; deliberately *not* the full
  mesh/presence discovery); Redis client = **Lettuce** (Reactor-native, matches `reactive-postgres`, battle-tested,
  robust pub/sub + auto-reconnect); module = new self-initializing extension **`extensions/sync-over-async`**;
  tests = **embedded Redis** (codemonstur `embedded-redis`, arm64; Testcontainers/Docker fallback) + an **embedded
  Kafka** extracted from `connectors/adapters/kafka/kafka-standalone` (`EmbeddedKafka.java`) for unit tests, with
  `kafka-standalone` for integration. Pod identity = `Platform.getOrigin()`. **Reliability cornerstones** (from
  review): payload in Redis `SETEX` is the source of truth, pub/sub is wake-up only, and a **final Redis read before
  timeout** is MVP-required (correctness independent of pub/sub); race-safe idempotent future completion.
  **Phase plan → MVP:** P1 = return-route engine (TDD, embedded Redis, no Kafka — cross-pod return, timeout→408,
  duplicate, orphan, missed-pubsub→final-read); P2 = Kafka legs (outbound notifier + inbound adapter, trace headers,
  mock SoR loopback); P3 = REST facade + e2e (+ trace via the OTel forwarder); P4 (post-MVP) = guardrails/503/metrics,
  two-JVM test, docs. **Note:** trace-across-Kafka is *not* free — needs cid + `traceparent` in Kafka headers + the
  inbound adapter rebuilding trace context.
  **Status (2026-06-25): scaffold + P1 ✅ done.** Module `extensions/sync-over-async` (pkg `org.platformlambda.sync`):
  `PendingRequests` (race-safe idempotent registry + max-pending), `ReturnRouteStore` (Lettuce `SETEX`/`GET` for
  `request:`/`response:` keys), `ReturnRouteCoordinator` (per-pod: `begin`/`awaitResponse`-with-final-read/`deliver`;
  pub/sub callback dispatches the blocking read to a virtual thread to avoid stalling the Lettuce event loop).
  16 tests vs embedded Redis (incl. cross-pod return, timeout, missed-notification→final-read, orphan, duplicate);
  JaCoCo 93.6% line, **85% gate enforced**.
  **Status (2026-06-26): MVP complete + building blocks extracted into a library** (commit `c8824519`).
  P2 (Kafka legs) → P3 (REST facade `test.endpoint`, the composable way: `event-script-engine` + `rest.yaml` →
  `sync-to-async` flow) → P4 (refactor the raw legs into composable **building blocks**: a drop-n-forget Kafka
  **notification function** + a **Kafka Flow Adapter** that routes each topic into an Event Script flow,
  one poll-loop thread per topic, synchronous request + commit-after-process = at-least-once). Full round-trip
  proven: `REST → http.flow.adapter → sync-to-async → test.endpoint (begin+notify) → Kafka topic-1 → adapter →
  system-of-record (echo+notify topic-2) → Kafka topic-2 → adapter → soa-reply → coordinator.deliver → Redis
  return route → HTTP 200 / 408`. **OTel span propagation across Kafka fixed without touching `event-script-engine`**
  (use the low-level `PostOffice` API: notification stamps its own span into the Kafka `traceparent`; the consumer
  parses it and `forward.setSpanId(parentSpanId)` so the flow chains onto it — `WorkerHandler:103` adopts the
  event span-id as the function's parent; validated against the telemetry log = one continuous trace, the two
  notification hops are the bridge spans). **Then promoted the pair to a reusable library** (Eric's call) —
  see `thread-minimalist-kafka-adapter` (now fulfilled): `system/minimalist-kafka` (`org.platformlambda.mini.kafka`,
  depends on `event-script-engine`, 87% cov, standalone embedded-Kafka e2e); `sync-over-async` now depends on it
  and is purely the Redis return-route engine (96% cov, 20 tests). Both green in the reactor on JDK 21.
  **Remaining (post-MVP):** ~~Redis coordinator config-driven init~~ **done** ([[soa-config-driven-init]]),
  ~~consumer partition-pinning~~ **done 2026-06-27** ([[kafka-partition-pinning]]), ~~module docs~~ **done
  2026-06-27** (mkdocs guides — [[kafka-soa-docs]]); still open — 503 guardrails/metrics, two-JVM test,
  per-module README (code-level); and Gradle build (`thread-add-gradle-build`).
  Also done this sprint: externalized Kafka client config ([[kafka-client-config-templates]]), configurable
  per-binding consumer group, and the Copilot-review hardening (incl. [[kafka-flow-failure-dlq]]).
  **2026-07-02 extension (PR #133, `feature/kafka-regex-dlq-commit-mode`):** regex topic subscription
  (`topic-pattern`), per-binding `dlq-topic` (replaces `kafka.flow.dlq.suffix`), `auto-commit` delivery
  mode (`max-poll-records` configurable), and `metadata.*` (topic/partition/offset/timestamp/key) injected
  into the flow input dataset. `KafkaConsumerBinding` (builder pattern) carries all per-binding config.
  PR open: https://github.com/Accenture/mercury-composable/pull/133
  **Review round 1 (2026-07-03, Copilot) applied:** merged `main` (PR #132) clean; fixed the inbound
  business-cid loss ([[kafka-flow-consumer-cid-header]]) + the stale `kafka-demo` DLQ-suffix config.
  **E2E-validated** against `sync-over-async-demo` (byte[] round-trip, 3-pod trace continuity, cid
  propagation, cross-pod Redis return route, 408 timeout).
  **Review round 2 (2026-07-03):** corrected the stale "model.cid is RPC noise" comments in the two
  test-resource sink flows (the round-1 fix made model.cid carry the Kafka cid); added embedded-Kafka
  `KafkaFlowAdapterTest` assertions that a task's `getMyCorrelationId()` == the sent cid, regression-guarding
  the fix end-to-end. See [[kafka-flow-consumer-cid-header]].
  **Terminology refactor (2026-07-04):** renamed the ambiguous `correlationId` naming to
  `businessCorrelationId`/`internalCorrelationId` across event-script-engine, minimalist-kafka,
  platform-core's HTTP path, and `extensions/sync-over-async` — Java identifiers only (fields/locals/internal
  constants); `EventEnvelope.cid`, `PostOffice.getMyCorrelationId()`, and all wire header strings/config keys
  are unchanged. Full reactor + all affected test suites green. See
  [[business-vs-internal-correlation-id-terminology]].
  **Test-infra improvements (2026-07-04, reviewer-driven):** (1) added `topic-pattern` embedded-Kafka e2e
  test proving `subscribe(Pattern)` + `input.metadata.*` surfaces the concrete matched topic/partition
  (was mock/config-only); (2) renamed the JSON schema-registry test path `schema-*`→`json-*` to sit
  parallel to the Avro case; (3) split the shared `schema-sink-flow`/`SchemaSinkTask` (an agile artifact -
  JSON first, Avro bolted on) into per-format `json-sink-flow`/`JsonSinkTask` + `avro-sink-flow`/
  `AvroSinkTask`, removing the latent shared-queue coupling (codec id-dispatch still proven by
  `SchemaCodecTest`). minimalist-kafka 78 tests green.
  **Review-driven hardening pass (2026-06-26, Claude Code):** applied the Copilot review
  (`draft-design-specs/kafka-sync-over-async-review.md`) via `apply-critique` — 6 fixes across both modules:
  mk#1 producer failure-logging callback (still drop-n-forget), mk#2 consumer retry→DLQ (`kafka-flow-failure-dlq`),
  mk#3 fail-fast flow-adapter config validation; soa#1 atomic-reservation cap (TOCTTOU), soa#2 explicit Redis
  DEL cleanup on success, soa#3 `start()` double-invocation guard + graceful `close()`. Deferred design nits
  mk#4 (`KafkaRuntime` singleton), mk#5 (poll loop on platform thread — non-issue), soa#4 (coordinator
  decomposition). Green: minimalist-kafka 12 tests, sync-over-async 24 tests, both coverage gates met. (The
  older `evaluation_feedback_report.md` is a stale Gemini Phases-1&2 report describing pre-extraction code —
  superseded, not the Copilot review.)
