/**
 * You can add this interface to your TypedLambdaFunction or KotlinLambdaFunction
 * to catch object casting exception.
 * <p>
 *     The system will do best effort to map PoJo if you define a PoJo or a Map
 *     as input in the TypedLambdaFunction (or KotlinLambdaFunction).
 * <p>
 *     This is designed to catch casting of Java primitive to a Map or PoJo since
 *     it is not possible to do meaningful mapping.
 * <p>
 *     You can implement this interface to handle this type of Casting exception.
 * <p>
 *     IMPORTANT:
 *     If you are using Event Script, the engine will guarantee that Java primitive
 *     is not mapped into the input of a Composable function in an event flow.
 *     Therefore, there is no need to use this interface to catch casting
 *     exception when using Event Script.
